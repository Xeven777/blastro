# Tell HN: Merry Christmas – What the Holiday Post Reveals About Hacker News Culture  

**Quick take**  
- *What it is*: A “Tell HN” post that spreads holiday cheer, showcases ASCII art, and invites community interaction.  
- *Why it matters*: It’s a pulse check on HN’s vibe, a low‑stakes experiment in site‑wide theming, and a showcase for developer creativity.  
- *Who should care*: Community managers, senior devs, and agency teams that want to gauge how tech‑savvy audiences respond to informal, seasonal outreach.  

## Why “Tell HN” Still Gets Clicks  

Hacker News is a stripped‑down forum where the headline is the only real hook. A “Tell HN” prefix tells readers, “Hey, this isn’t a product pitch, it’s a quick note from a fellow hacker.” When the note says “Merry Christmas,” the post instantly becomes a communal holiday card.  

The thread (id 46380168) exploded with ASCII trees, custom‑theme extensions, and nostalgic anecdotes. Even the site’s subtle color shift—red and green numbers for a day—sparked a cascade of comments about UI tweaks and accessibility. For agencies, that’s a case study in how a simple, authentic message can drive **organic engagement** without any marketing spend.

## The Anatomy of a Holiday Post  

| Element | What it looks like | Why it works |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Headline** | `Tell HN: Merry Christmas` | “Tell HN” signals community‑first, while the holiday tag adds relevance. |
| **Body** | Minimal text, often an ASCII art block or a short greeting. | Low cognitive load; readers skim and up‑vote if they like the art. |
| **Comments** | Users reply with their own art, theme hacks, or personal stories. | Turns a one‑off post into a **mini‑forum** that lives for days. |
| **Meta‑hooks** | Links to GitHub repos (e.g., a Christmas‑lights web component). | Provides tangible value, encouraging click‑throughs and forks. |

The post’s **ASCII tree**—a series of slashes, underscores, and asterisks—served as both a visual treat and a code‑snippet playground. Readers dissected the formatting, discussed `pre` tags, and even suggested improvements for screen‑reader accessibility.  

## Community Traditions and Techie Twists  

Hacker News has a long‑standing tradition of **seasonal theming**. Each December, the site’s header subtly shifts to holiday hues, and the “Tell HN” greeting becomes a yearly staple.  

Developers riff on this by:  

- Building **custom extensions** that inject animated snowflakes or color‑blind‑friendly palettes.  
- Publishing **interactive demos** (e.g., a live‑coded Merkle‑tree Christmas ornament).  
- Sharing **open‑source repos** that other users can fork and adapt for their own sites.  

These contributions create a virtuous loop: the original post gets up‑votes, the extensions get stars, and the community feels a shared sense of ownership.

## Best Practices for Posting Seasonal Greetings  

1. **Keep it short and scannable** – A single line of text plus the art is enough.  
2. **Use proper formatting** – Wrap ASCII art in `<pre><code>` blocks; it preserves spacing and signals “code” to the platform.  
3. **Add a value add** – Include a link to a GitHub gist, a live demo, or a helpful resource (e.g., a quiz or tutorial).  
4. **Be inclusive** – A simple “Happy holidays” works if you’re unsure of your audience’s beliefs.  
5. **Consider accessibility** – Mention that the art may not render well for screen readers; provide a plain‑text description.  

## Pitfalls to Avoid  

- **Over‑decorating**: Adding images directly to the post breaks HN’s minimalistic aesthetic and can be flagged.  
- **Spammy links**: Self‑promotional URLs without context trigger moderation.  
- **Heavy fonts**: Using non‑ASCII characters (e.g., emojis) may not survive the site’s sanitization pipeline.  
- **Ignoring mobile**: ASCII art that looks great on a desktop can become a jumbled mess on a phone; test with a narrow viewport.  

## Real‑World Use Cases: From ASCII Trees to Custom Themes  

### 1. Showcasing a Holiday‑Themed Component  
A developer posted a link to a lightweight JavaScript widget that adds animated Christmas lights to any webpage. The repo gained 120 stars in 24 hours, demonstrating how a simple “holiday hack” can become a **viral open‑source snippet**.  

### 2. Teaching Formatting Tricks  
One comment dissected the post’s whitespace handling, explaining how HN renders text indented by two spaces as a code block. Junior devs used that as a quick lesson in **markdown quirks**.  

### 3. Building Community‑Owned Extensions  
A small team released a browser extension that forces the HN header into a deep‑red theme for the season. Users praised the effort, and the repo’s issue tracker turned into a discussion board for future seasonal tweaks.

These examples show that a humble holiday greeting can double as a **tech showcase**, a **learning resource**, and a **community‑building tool**—all without a marketing budget.  

## FAQ  

**Q: Can I post a “Tell HN” greeting for any holiday?**  
A: Absolutely. The format works year‑round; just replace the holiday name. Keep the tone sincere and avoid overt commercial language.  

**Q: Will the post survive moderation?**  
A: As long as it follows HN’s guidelines—no external advertising, proper formatting, and a clear “Tell HN” prefix—it’s safe. Posts that turn into self‑promotion threads are usually flagged.  

**Q: How do I make my ASCII art accessible?**  
A: Include a brief alt‑text description after the art, like “ASCII Christmas tree: a triangle of slashes and asterisks.” This helps screen‑reader users understand the visual intent.  

**Q: Is it worth linking to a GitHub repo in a holiday post?**  
A: Yes, if the repo adds genuine value (e.g., a theme switcher or a fun demo). The community loves useful, shareable code.  

**Q: What’s the ideal time to post a holiday greeting?**  
A: Early in the day (UTC) of the holiday. It catches both U.S. and European readers before the traffic dip that usually follows lunch.
