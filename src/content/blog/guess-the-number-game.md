Greetings, sweet people! I'm back with a project that combines my love for coding with the captivating (and slightly terrifying) world of Squid Game: a Next.js-powered "Guess the Number" game with a unique twist! ️‍

This wasn't just about recreating a childhood classic; I wanted to infuse the familiar concept with the suspense and strategy that made Squid Game such a global phenomenon. The result is an intense, brain-teasing experience that will have you on the edge of your seat, questioning every click.

## Learning Curve to Victory:

Building this game wasn't just about entertainment; it was a steep learning curve that pushed my Next.js skills to the limit. Here are some key takeaways:

1. Learnt about routing in Next.js 14 , in app router.
2. Learnt about using hooks in Next.js
3. Made the UI/UX appealing with squid game theme with also an engaging and mysterious background music.
4. Tried to follow the best methods for efficient coding which gives it a Lighthouse score of 100 !
